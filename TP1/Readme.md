##Subject
Making a FTP Server which is working with ftp in shell and/or filezilla for example

##Usage
1. Launch the `Server.java` main and specify a `directory` for the server  and a `port`
2. Launch ftp in terminal with args : IP port
3. Use existing commands such as `user` `pass` `recv` `put`

##Notes
I wanted to make more tests but all my `processXXX` methods are private, I think it is meaningless to put those methods in "public" just to test them.
